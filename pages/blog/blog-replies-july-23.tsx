            Great post I also talked about how remote learning makes university much more affordable, I think you made some great points in this aspect. I also really liked how you used khan academy as an example for multimedia they really are exceptional at leveraging the power of distributed learning.<br/>
            <br/>
            One of the things I like about how you formatted your blog was your direct and to the point formatting for the weeks questions. I have struggled with making my blogs into one narrative to answer all the questions. I think I will format mine similarly.<br/>
            <br/>
            One bit of constructive feedback is it would have been awesome to have some pictures with your blog to help connect the topics!<br/>

            Hi Abby great blog,<br/>
            <br/>
            I really like how you included quotes that were relevant to the topic of your post in your blog that really added a nice feel and broke up the pacing of your blog. I will definitely be poaching that technique and do the same in my next blog post<br/>
            <br/>    
            I like how you picked wikis as a big step forward in digital education tools. For me that is such a ubiquitous part of education that I just consider that as the default and I hadnâ€™t really thought of a time before those existed.<br/>
            <br/>
            Great work!<br/>

            Hi Avni!
            <br/>
            Your blog page looks nice and polished and I like the way that you embedded links referencing what you are talking about in your blog that gave good context to the topics you were referencing.<br/>
            <br/>
            Learning management systems really have revolutionized how we think about learning in the modern age and I liked insight you provided about this topic.<br/>
            <br/>
            One thing I would have liked to see on your blog is more multi media pictures relating to the topics you are talking about.<br/>
            <br/>
            Keep up the good work.<br/>
            <br/>
            </div>
            {/* Replace the above content with your content */}
            <CommentForm blog_id={2}/>
